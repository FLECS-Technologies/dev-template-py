# Repository template for developing with python

This template can be used to jumpstart and unify development in python. It was generated
using
the [pyopensci python package template](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/pyos-package-template)
and [copier](https://github.com/copier-org/copier):

```bash
copier copy gh:pyopensci/pyos-package-template
```

You can read more about the project structure in [DEVELOPMENT](./DEVELOPMENT.md).

The resulting project was filled with a simple example application.
